# SQL Server Failover Cluster Homelab

This repository documents my project to build and test a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) in a homelab environment using Proxmox, Windows Server, and shared storage.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to simulate a real-world SQL Server Failover Cluster deployment for learning purposes. The environment includes:

- A domain controller (Active Directory, DNS)
- Two SQL Server nodes (SQL01 and SQL02)
- Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC)
- Shared storage via iSCSI

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

When I first configured shared storage using the built-in **Windows iSCSI Target Server**, the cluster setup worked â€” but only in **graceful failover scenarios**. When I simulated a failure, the SQL Server role failed to come online on the secondary node.

After troubleshooting, I discovered that:

> ðŸ’¡ **Windows Server Failover Clustering requires shared disks to support SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations (PR)** â€” including the ability to preempt and transfer ownership during a node failure.

The built-in iSCSI target does not fully support these operations, which caused disk reservation conflicts during failover.

## ðŸ”„ Current Progress: Testing StarWind VSAN Free

To address this limitation, Iâ€™m currently testing [**StarWind Virtual SAN Free**](https://www.starwindsoftware.com/starwind-virtual-san-free) as an alternative iSCSI target. It claims to support:

- iSCSI protocol
- High availability clustering
- Support for Windows Failover Clustering

I am specifically testing whether it supports **full SCSI-3 Persistent Reservation functionality**, including the behavior required for ungraceful failover scenarios.

## ðŸ“š Project Includes

- Configuration notes for:
  - Active Directory and DNS
  - SQL Server cluster nodes
  - Failover Cluster setup and validation
  - iSCSI target testing and shared disk configuration
- Troubleshooting logs
- PowerShell commands used
- Failover test results

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Complete testing with StarWind VSAN Free
- Explore SQL Server Always On Availability Groups as a comparison
- Add client connection tests to monitor failover behavior from the application side

This is a hands-on homelab project to help me better understand SQL Server high availability, Windows clustering, and shared storage infrastructure. Iâ€™m documenting the process to help others who might encounter similar limitations with entry-level iSCSI targets.
